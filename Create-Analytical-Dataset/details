Project Overview
This project is the first part of a two-part series. In the first part, you will blend and format data and deal with outliers.

For the second part, you will use your cleaned up dataset to create another linear regression model. The difference this time is that you will have to choose which variable(s) are the most important for the model using new techniques learned in the Selecting Predictor Variables section.
